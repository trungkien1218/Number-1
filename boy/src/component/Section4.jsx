                    <p class="text3-sec4">I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack
                        development (React.js &
                        Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products
                        to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code
                        matters to me.</p>
                    <p class="text3-sec4">I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued to
                        grow and evolve as a
                        developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my
                        early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web
                        applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase
                        and much more.</p>
                    <p class="text3-sec4">When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on twitter
                        or on indie
                        hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying some free time. You can follow me on
                        Twitter where I share tech-related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub.</p>
